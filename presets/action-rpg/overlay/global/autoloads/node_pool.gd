# node_pool.gd
# Unified spawn pool for the action-rpg preset. Acquire/release a single API for
# both pooled and fresh instantiation, so spawn-heavy entities (projectiles, hit
# numbers, common enemies) avoid per-frame instantiation spikes.
#
# Pooled nodes are cached by scene resource_path and reused. On acquire, reset() is
# called; on release, set_enabled(false) is called and the node is parked. These are
# the Component lifecycle hooks (see component_architecture.md).
