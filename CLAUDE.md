# Godot Data-Driven Template

A Godot 4.6 project skeleton for data-driven games. Provides four reusable "spines" — data pipeline, boot orchestration, save system, and scene routing — with a working vertical slice to validate the full chain.

## Agent environment note (sandboxed shell vs. real files)

The sandboxed Linux shell can return **phantom file corruption** for files in this repo — blocks of NUL bytes, mid-token truncation, "binary file matches", or wrong byte counts — especially right after a write. This is a mount artifact, NOT real disk damage.

- The Read/Edit file tools are authoritative. After modifying a file, verify it with **Read**, never by `cat`/`hexdump`/`wc`/`grep` through the shell. If Read shows clean content, the file is fine — stop.
- Never diagnose "corrupted files" from a shell read alone, and never `git restore`/overwrite working-tree files to "recover" from shell-reported corruption — that risks discarding genuine uncommitted work over a false reading.
- `git` against the object DB (`git show HEAD:<file>`, `git log`, `git diff`) is reliable; working-tree file-content reads through the shell mount are not.

## The Four Spines

1. **Data pipeline** — YAML (human-authored) → `.tres` (generated) → `ResourceDirLoader` → Registry → game reads.
2. **Boot orchestration** — `RegistryCoordinator` unifies register / migrate / validate lifecycle across all registries.
3. **Save system** — Section-based JSON: each system registers a `SaveSection` with `SaveManager`; save/load dispatch to all sections.
4. **Scene routing** — `GameManager._SCENES` dict + `go_to(key, payload)` + `consume_payload()`.

```

## Autoloads (load order)

`EventBus → AudioManager → RegistryCoordinator → ExampleRegistry → ExampleSaveSection → SaveManager → GameManager`

`RegistryCoordinator` orchestrates boot: registries call `register(self)` in `_ready()`, then `GameManager._ready()` calls `run_migrations()` and `run_validation()`.

When adding a new registry, insert it after `RegistryCoordinator` and before `SaveManager`.

## Data Pipeline

Entities are authored in `data/yaml/*.yaml`, converted to `.tres` via `dev/tools/yaml_to_tres.py`. Validate with `dev/tools/validate_yaml.py`. Reverse with `dev/tools/tres_to_yaml.py`.

The `.tres` output directories are gitignored — run the pipeline on every fresh checkout before opening the project.

**To add a new entity type**, follow `dev/tools/prompts/yaml_generation/base.md` (six steps: define resource class → author YAML → write spec → register spec → write registry → wire up).

## Save System

Each system that needs persistence registers itself with `SaveManager`:

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    SaveManager.register_section(self)

func section_id() -> String: return "my_system"
func to_dict() -> Dictionary: return { ... }
func from_dict(data: Dictionary) -> void: ...
```

`SaveManager.load()` is called once from `GameManager._ready()` after all sections have registered. For new autoload-based sections, insert them before `SaveManager` in `project.godot`.

## Scene Routing

Add scenes to the `_SCENES` const in `game_manager.gd`, then navigate with:

```gdscript
GameManager.go_to("my_scene")
# or with payload:
GameManager.go_to("my_scene", { "data": value })
var payload = GameManager.consume_payload()
```

## Conventions (quick reference)

- **Naming**: snake_case files, PascalCase classes, UPPER_SNAKE constants. See `dev/standards/naming_conventions.md`.
- **Registries**: extend `ResourceRegistry`; required API: `get_<singular>_by_id`, `get_all_<plural>`, `size`. See `dev/standards/registries.md`.
- **Scene architecture**: block scenes follow `dev/standards/block_scene_architecture_standard.md`. Node-source rule (persistent nodes in `.tscn`, not `add_child()`) and "no `[connection]` in `.tscn`" are **lint-enforced** — see `dev/standards/standards_enforcement.md`. Run `python dev/tools/lint_standards.py --files <changed>` before finishing if you are an agent without the in-loop lint hook.
- **Commits**: conventional commits format. See `dev/skills/conventional_commits.md`.
- **Iterate resources, not ids**: pass Resource refs outside serialization boundaries. String ids are for save/load only.
- **Docstrings**: every `.gd` starts with `# filename` + one-line purpose. All public functions and complex private functions get a `##` GDDoc comment. Never strip existing comments when editing.
- **Docs layering**: 3 levels, each fact lives in exactly one. L1 vision (≤5 files, rarely changes), L2 systems/plans (design intent + flow, present tense), L3 detail (code docstrings). Full rules in `dev/docs/README.md`.
- **Tracking**: `CHANGELOG.md` (append-only shipped history) and `TODO.md` (single forward surface: `## Active` in-flight flows, `Plan`/`Chore`/`Bug` one-liners, `## Draft` for concepts). Multi-step work lives in `dev/docs/plans/<x>.md` with a one-line pointer in `TODO.md`.

## Don'ts

- Don't hand-edit `.tres` files under `data/tres/` — use the YAML pipeline.
- Don't add display-name wrappers or fallback-to-id accessors on registries.
- Don't put code-level detail (function names, field lists) in `dev/docs/systems/` — that belongs in code comments.
- Don't keep a living "Done" list anywhere except `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Don't put forward-looking sections in `systems/` docs — route forward items to `## Open Questions` or `TODO.md`.
- Don't create a separate `draft/` folder — the draft tier is the `## Draft` section of `TODO.md`.
